# heart-disease-classification-ml
Python machine learning modelling to classify whether a patient has a heart-disease or not

## Introduction

Project contains the dataset of patients with a set of features. A goal here is to predict whether a patient has a heart-disease or not. 

## Analysis

Different set of analysis has been performed on a data to ensure the data cleaning and preprocessing. Important insights have been gained from the dataset and rationale explained.

## Modelling

Modelling has been done using different scikit-learn models and results are compared. Models are tweaked for better performance.
